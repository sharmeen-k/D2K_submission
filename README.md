# Machine Learning Assessment Submission

This repository contains my submission for the Machine Learning assessment. It showcases an end-to-end workflow for developing and evaluating a machine learning model. The notebook is structured to provide clear insights into the process and demonstrates my understanding of key concepts.

## Contents
- **ML_notebook.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the assessment submission.
- **Data**: (Optional) If the dataset is included, this folder will contain the raw and/or processed data used in the notebook.
- **Results**: (Optional) Outputs or visualizations generated during the project.

## Features of the Notebook
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps for cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling features.
2. **Model Development**: Training a machine learning model using an appropriate algorithm.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance using metrics and visualizations.
4. **Documentation**: Explanations in markdown cells to provide clarity on each step.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ML_notebook.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells in sequence to reproduce the workflow.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn (ensure these are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt` if a requirements file is provided).

## Acknowledgments
This project is part of an academic assessment to demonstrate proficiency in machine learning workflows and techniques.
